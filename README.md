# go-strings

go-strings prints out ASCII strings found in a binary file. This is similar to the `strings` command on \*NIX systems, but with fewer features and different flags.


## Usage

```shell
go-strings [-length <length>] filename
```
Length is the minimum number of characters required for a string to be printed.
